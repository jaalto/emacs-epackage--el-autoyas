* About
el-autoyas is a small complement to yasnippet for emacs-lisp-mode.  It
provides automatically created yasnippets from eldoc argument lists.
* Requirements
 - [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]]
 - eldoc
* Usage
 - To expand the snippet, type the function name or abbrevation and
   then press =TAB=
 - To jump to the next field press =TAB=.  If you did not change the
   field, either the parameter is kept, or replaced with =nil= or
   nothing depending on the argument list.

* Limitations
 - Currently does not support common lisp key functions
 - Unclear if nested snippet expansion is supported.
* Loading el-autoyas in ~/.emacs
You may use marmalade-repo and ELPA to install el-autoyas, or put it
into your load-path and put the following in =~/.emacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'el-autoyas)
#+END_SRC
